# Project Specification: Automated Restaurant Marketing Agent

## 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an automated AI agent that manages and executes marketing tasks for a restaurant. The agent will create and distribute content across multiple platforms, including social media, the restaurant's website, and email campaigns, based on provided themes, inspiration, and daily inputs.

## 2. Core Features

- **Content Generation:** The agent will autonomously write compelling marketing copy for various platforms.
- **Multi-platform Distribution:**
    - **Social Media:** Post content to Facebook and Instagram.
    - **Website:** Update the restaurant's website (built on Squarespace).
    - **Email:** Draft email marketing campaigns.
- **Input-driven Content:** The content strategy will be guided by:
    - A central topical theme.
    - General marketing inspiration.
    - Daily inputs, such as photos and notes, provided by the user.

## 3. Technical Architecture & Requirements

- **Core Framework:** The agent will be built using LangGraph and LangServe to orchestrate the AI workflows.
- **Backend Infrastructure:** The application will be deployed on a cloud platform such as Modal or Replit.
- **Execution Schedule:** The agent will operate on a cron job, running every one to two days to generate and publish new content.
- **API Layer:**
    - A robust REST API will be the primary interface for the agent.
    - This API must be designed to integrate with services like Zapier and n8n, allowing for flexible input triggers (e.g., sending an email to a specific address or a text message to a number).
- **User Interface & Monitoring:**
    - While a dedicated UI console is a possibility, the primary interfaces for monitoring and interaction will be the built-in UIs provided by LangGraph and LangServe for transparency and telemetry.
    - Inputs (photos, ideas, notes) will be accepted through the API, which can be triggered by various frontends, including a simple UI, email, or text messages.

## 4. Definition of Success

The project will be considered successful when the following criteria are met:

- An automated AI agent is successfully deployed and running in a production environment.
- The agent reliably generates and posts fresh content every 1-2 days based on the specified inputs.
- The REST API is fully functional, enabling seamless integration with third-party services like Zapier for triggering content creation workflows.
- The system provides clear visibility into its operations through the LangServe and LangGraph UIs.
